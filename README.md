# What are PS Live courses?

These classes are _open enrollment_ (OE), meaning that anyone from any organization can sign up until the class is full. Therefore the class is likely to be made up of students from mutiple organizations.

That said, they often don't feel any different than a class you teach for a specific client. Once the introductions are done, it's easy to forget the students are from multiple organizations and it would only seem to be an issue if you intended to discuss an organization-specific way of doing something.
