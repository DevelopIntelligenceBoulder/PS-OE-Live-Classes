In January 2021, Pluralsight acquired __`next.tech`__, a company know for its on-demand technology skills platform. The acquisition allows the integration of hands-on experiences (in the form of Ubuntu "sandboxes") directly into existing content and the intention is to use the __`next.tech`__ platform in our PS Live and ProServ classes whenever possible.

Here is a short video which demonstrates the features of these sandboxes for the PS Live courses: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFpY2Vvt9gI4DU05QChfbVAGx6UPo7KQ

In addition, the sandboxes can be reached through any standard PS video course which makes use of them, such as https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/getting-started-with-go/table-of-contents
